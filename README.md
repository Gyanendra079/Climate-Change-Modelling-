# Climate-Change-Modelling-
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to analyze historical climate data, identify trends, and predict future changes in key climate indicators (temperature anomalies, global mean sea level, atmospheric COâ‚‚ concentration, and climate-related disaster frequency) using machine learning techniques, we seek to build a predictive model
